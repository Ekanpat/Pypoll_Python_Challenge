## Overview of Election Audit

We were previoulsy tasked to go through the data set and determine the candidate winner of the congressional election.
We did that and visualize theresults. Now, ultimately, it was important to determine the county vote and related votes and assign the largest county winner and its votes. That's the main purpose of the current task whch Tom requested support and discuss the same information with the Colorado Board of Elections.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information upon when its run: 
  - Total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - Total number of votes each candidate received
  - Percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary: 

The final script can be utlized for all sorts of elections provided basics modificatiosn are made on the intended outcomes. The election commission could add addional inputs such as number of abstention, votes per county at the national level, demographic of the voters and gendrs of candidates.
